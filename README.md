- #### Build Info
```bash
!# INFO
# Not all PKG Maintainers create `RELEASES`, and those that do, rarely create for all `ARCH` 
# Primary AIM is to not waste time trying to compile a specific binary for a specific ARCH
# Only Include builds of CORE Utilities & PKGs I often use (mostly in restricted environments)

!# Process
# Some are Cloned || Mirrored direct from PKG Maintainers
--> Fetch `@latest` Source --> Build Using `https://github.com/dockcross/dockcross` for each 'ARCH'

!# Cautions
'100% FoolProof' : NO
'Guarantees' : NONE
```
